# Bamazon

Created an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, the MySQL NPM Package, and the Inquirer Package and Cli-Table Package.

The application will take in orders from customers and deplete from the store's total supplies.

Initializing node bamazon.js in the command line brings up the storefront. It will ask you what you'd like to purchase by item number and how many.  A total cost for quantity order will the appear if enough items are in stock.  If there is not enough stock, it will display an message to that effect.
